## sla - R Package

This package considers the simplest case of ANCOVA, the two-group, straight-line case. We have two groups (a factor variable) and a single regressor (x, numeric) against a single criterion variable (y, numeric).

sla is still under development. Use at your own risk.

TODO:

- fix cmd check issues (in nick's branch cmd-check)
- add "all" argument to plot.sla (check vignette)
- nick will read vignette top to bottom
- nice to have: move documentation to roxygen
- update description file with author info, etc.
