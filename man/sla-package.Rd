\title{Two-Group, Straight-Line ANCOVA}
\description{
Fits four linear models ("A", "B", "C", and "D") for the two-group, straight-line ANCOVA problem. (A) Model "A", the full model - fits two intercepts and two slopes (separate intercepts and slopes for each group); (B) Model "B", a reduced model - fits single intercept and single slope to all the data (ignoring group designation); (C) Model "C", a reduced model - fits two different intercepts and a single, common slope; (D) Model "D", a reduced model - fits a single, common intercept and two different slopes.

The \code{'sla'} function fits four linear models ("A", "B", "C", and "D"), described above, in connection with the two-group, straight-line ANCOVA problem. The \code{'print'} function produces directly interpretable coefficients (intercepts and slopes) for each model "A", "B", "C", and "D".  The \code{'summary'} function presents two tables.  The top table displays the number of parameters fit, the residual degrees of freedom, the residual sum of squares, and the residual mean square for each model "A", "B", "C", and "D". The bottom table displays reductions in sums of squares, F statistics, and probabilities associated with models "B", "C", and "D",respectively, vs. model "A", thus testing for three null hypotheses: (1) equivalence of the data sets for the two groups, (2) equivalence of slopes for the two groups, and (3) equivalence of intercepts for the two groups.
